Todo list:
	
	[ ] Create level editor? Thinking I'll just do this simply in html but we'll see..
		[ ] Design system for world data.
			could just do single characters, but might be limited. could do every tile separated by a symbol like ~ or something, and then put data between. Can be raw like 1~1~0p~0b~1 where 1 is a solid tile, 0 is an empty tile (ie a background tile) and the followign letter means button or player. Maybe like that
	
	[X] Get player movement working
	
	[ ] Main menu
	
	[ ] UI?
	
	[ ] Create dialogue box system (probably part of UI)
	
	[ ] Come up with shapes, abilities, and such. Currently started in the design doc

	[ ] Art. Think I'm going to try to go for a pixel art Portal style. Think I'll start with white and black tiles. They'll be sort of like the current square shape, a white ish color with a darker border. Will probably make a big sheet of them, with different shading and configuration and little defects. Like can add one that's 4 smaller squares, or two 1x2 squares, or a 1x2 and two small squares. That sort of thing. then go from there.
