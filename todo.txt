Todo list:
	
	Create level editor?
		Design system for world data.
			could just do single characters, but might be limited. could do every tile separated by a symbol like ~ or something, and then put data between. Can be raw like 1~1~0p~0b~1 where 1 is a solid tile, 0 is an empty tile (ie a background tile) and the followign letter means button or player. Maybe like that
	
	Get player movement working
	
	Main menu
	
	UI?
	
	Create dialogue box system (probably part of UI)
